_**Previous post:** [WDI: The First Quarter](/blog/wdi-the-first-quarter/)_

We’ve just reached the halfway mark. Over the past three weeks, we have learnt the [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/ "Ruby on Rails") MVC (Model, View, Controller) Framework, completed our first (individual) project and started learning JavaScript. It’s been an absolute whirlwind. Here’s what we covered:

_**Week 4: Rails MVC**_

*   Scaffold
*   Generators
*   Routes, Controllers and Views
*   ActiveRecord Associations
*   Form helpers
*   Partials
*   Project brainstorming (individual project)

Moving from Sinatra to Rails was a real eye opener. Sinatra is great for small projects. I deployed the following (simple) applications using the Sinatra framework:

*   [OMDB Lookup](https://omdb-lookup.herokuapp.com/ "OMDB Lookup")
*   [MTA Navigator](https://mta-navigator.herokuapp.com/ "MTA Navigator")
*   [WDI8 Ipsum](http://wdi8-ipsum.herokuapp.com/ "WDI8 Ipsum")

However, we learnt that if you’re wanting to build larger applications with an expectancy for many users, Rails is probably a better option. The framework itself has much more power, or “magic” as it is referred to in the wider community. One of the big selling points of Rails is [Active Record](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html "Ruby on Rails: Active Record Basics"), which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. We used Rails for our first project.

_**Week 5: Individual Project Week**_

Project Week was great fun! I set out to build a crowdfunding platform for charitable challenges, like the [ALS Ice Bucket Challenge](http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge.html "ALS Ice Bucket Challenge"). While the project needs a bit more work before it's ready for launch, I was pretty happy with the outcome:

*   [The Pledge: Demo Site](http://thepledge.herokuapp.com/ "The Pledge: Demo Site")
*   [The Pledge: Github Repository](https://github.com/liamdarmody/thepledge "The Pledge: Github Repository")

I’m keen to do some more work on this over the coming months and launch it with a quirky challenge. Any feedback or ideas are more than welcome.

_**Week 6: JavaScript**_

* Programming fundamentals in JS
* First class functions
* Prototypical Inheritance
* DOM Manipulation
* Events/Animation
* Jasmine
* Underscore.js

Starting on JavaScript this past week has been interesting. I can see a lot of potential here. Being able to manipulate the [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction "Document Object Model (DOM): Introduction") to create one-page applications is pretty damn cool. However, the most exciting aspect at this point is being able to tinker in the world of Internet connected things.

[Next week](/blog/wdi-the-third-quarter/ "WDI: The Third Quarter"), we’ll be moving onto JavaScript frameworks and getting ready for Project Two.

Tradition calls. Time to do [The Spit Bridge to Manly Walk](http://short-walks.com.au/new-south-wales/sydney/spit-bridge-to-manly-walk/ "The Spit Bridge to Manly Walk").
