Before starting the course, we are required to complete around _**50 hours**_ of prework. The goal of the prework is to provide exposure to crucial concepts in web-based programming that we'll be covering in-depth during the course.

Completion of this prework is mandatory. Here’s what it covered:

_**Part 1: Computer Basics**_

* OSX Basics (1 hour)
* Typing (1 hour)
* Command Line Basics (4 hours)

_**Part 2: Internet & Web Development Basics**_

* Internet Basics (1 hour)
* HTML & CSS (15 hours)

_**Part 3: Programming Basics & Version Control**_

* Ruby (25 hours)
* Git (6 hours)

[Next week](/blog/wdi-the-first-quarter/ "WDI: The First Quarter"), I’ll be dropping off the social grid for a while to be immersed in code for 12 straight weeks!
