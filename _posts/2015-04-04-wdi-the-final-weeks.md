_**Previous post:** [WDI: The Third Quarter](/blog/wdi-the-third-quarter/ "WDI: The Third Quarter")_

We've just finished WDI. It's been an absolute roller-coaster ride. I can't wait to get stuck into some code in the workplace (and my own projects). Here's what we covered in the final weeks:

_**Week 10: Performance, Optimisation, Advanced Rails**_

This week was dedicated to performance, optimisation and advanced rails skills. We learnt about [Regular Expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular Expressions"), [Rake](http://jasonseifer.com/2010/04/06/rake-tutorial "Rake"), [JavaScript Closures](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/ "JavaScript Closures"), [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails "RSpec for Rails"), [Cucumber](https://cukes.info/ "Cucumber") and some more [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/ "Backbone.js"). To finish the week off, we had a visit to [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/ "Atlassian") before diving into some research for out Final Project.

_**Week 11: Computer Science**_

* Binary, Hex
* Linked lists
* Recursion
* Time Complexity
* Sorting
* Group Lab

After a weekend of research and project spikes, we dived straight into Computer Science theory. We covered topics such as [algorithms](http://www.teaching-materials.org/algorithms/#/ "Intro to Algorithms"), [machine learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine Learning"), [recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_%28computer_science%29 "Recursion"), [software licensing](http://choosealicense.com/ "Software Licenses") and [data structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures "Data Structures"). We also learnt about well known computer scientists, mathematicians and books, such as [The Art of Unix Programming](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/ "The Art of Unix Programming").

Before our projects kicked off, each student was given the opportunity to conduct a "You Teach" session where we would run a short workshop on a topic that we cared about. We had a session on Golang, Google Maps and GIFs. I ran a short workshop on startups - _**A Whirlwind Intro to Starting, Learning & Optimising Fast**_.

We ran through our project proposals on Thursday and started work Friday morning. I set out to build an extensible website solution to speed up the validation process for entrepreneurs and growth hackers. I wanted to build a solution that made it easy for data-driven decision making. The product would be called [GrowthPal](http://www.growthpal.com.au/ "GrowthPal").

_**Week 12: Final Projects**_

Monday came around very quickly. Given our week was cut short, it was crunch time. We were burning the midnight oil every night since last week. The end result was worth it though. I finished up with a [polished product](http://www.growthpal.com.au/ "GrowthPal") that could be used to validate an idea with very little effort.

GrowthPal Features:

* Fully Extensible Web Application
* User Authentication
* Beautiful Design
* Admin & CMS
* Blog

GrowthPal Integrations:

* [VWO](https://vwo.com/ "Visual Website Optimiser"): Website Optimisation (AB Tests)
* [Intercom](https://www.intercom.io/ "Intercom.io"): Customer Communication
* [Mandrill](https://mandrill.com/ "Mandrill"): Transactional Emails
* [Disqus](https://disqus.com/ "Disqus"): Commenting
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/au "Stripe Payments"): Payments

On Wednesday night (before our Thursday demo), I decided to give [GrowthPal](http://www.growthpal.com.au/ "GrowthPal") a test-run for my girlfriend's eBook. Initial setup and deployment took _**1 hour, 12 minutes**_. Once it was up and running, I sent admin details over to her so she could update copy in the CMS. By the time it was my turn to demo, it was pretty much complete. There's still plenty of work I can do to improve GrowthPal but I was happy with what I got done in a week.

A huge thanks to [Joel](https://github.com/wofockham/ "Joel Turnbull") and [Jack](https://github.com/anonymous-wolf "Jack") for all their assistance and debugging throughout project week (and the course).

If anyone wants a [GrowthPal](http://www.growthpal.com.au/ "GrowthPal") website, let me know!
