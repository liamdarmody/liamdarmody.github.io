Having signed myself up for the [Web Development Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive/sydney "Web Development Immersive - General Assembly (Sydney)") (WDI) at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly") (GA), I have recently become a student again. In this series of posts, I would like to tell you why I chose to do the course and give you some insight into what I’m learning along the way.

First of all, I want to provide some context. Since the first day of university, I've had a job that has enabled me to practice and develop the skills that I was studying. While at university, I had a diverse mix of experience from working as a Consultant at [PwC](http://pwc.com.au/ "PwC"), starting [TEDxMacquarieUniversity](http://www.tedxmacquarieuniversity.com/ "TEDxMacquarieUniversity"), and starting a [Sponsorship Program](https://podio.com/site/sponsorships "Podio Sponsorships") for [Podio](https://podio.com/ "Podio") while on Exchange in Denmark. I also Co-founded two startups that we subsequently shutdown. Since then, I have recognised that I learn best by doing.

After graduating from a [Bachelor of Innovation and Entrepreneurship](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder/binne_binnent.html "Bachelor of Innovation and Entrepreneurship") at [University of Adelaide](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/ "University of Adelaide"), and recovering from my recent “startup failures”, I decided to dive head-first into [FitUsIn](http://www.fitusin.com/ "FitUsIn") - another startup. While the company was going through a pivot and new assumptions were being tested, I secured a job working with [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com "Freelancer.com"). I absolutely love the fast-paced environment of a startup and I’m glad to say that Freelancer.com still has that startup vibe.

In all of my recent roles, I’ve learnt about the importance of technical literacy. Whilst I am reasonably literate when it comes to web development, I keep finding myself wanting to learn more. I’ve been teaching myself basic HTML, CSS and Ruby (online) for some time now. There came a point where I decided if I wanted to become good at it, I would have to dedicate more time to it. I decided to do this course because it would hold me accountable for a 3-month period of intensive learning and could offer more tangible outcomes than any other options.

Why I want to learn web development:

*   To become a better product manager: I want to be able to speak the language and understand more technical jargon. This will also help me develop a higher level of empathy and understanding for the developers I work with.
*   To bring my own ideas to life: I wan to be able to build and maintain websites myself. I am particularly interested in rapid prototyping, agile development and UI/UX design.
