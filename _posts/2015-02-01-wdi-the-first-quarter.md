_**Previous post:** [WDI: Course Prework](/blog/wdi-course-prework/ "WDI: Course Prework")_

We’ve just come to the end of the third week. As the name of the course suggests, this has been an “immersive" experience. There isn’t much time for anything else. Each day, we start at 9am and finish around 5pm. I usually continue coding at GA before heading home for dinner. After dinner, I get straight back into it and get to bed around 12-1am. The next day, it starts all over.

While the experience has been incredibly tiring, I’m stoked with the classmates and instructional team we landed. Having done the prework on my own, I really appreciate having my classmates and instructors around to ask questions. The speed at which we are learning is incredible.

Here’s who’s teaching us:

* [Joel Turnbull](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/joel-turnbull/1051 "Joel Turnbull")
* [Daniel Tsui (DT)](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/daniel-tsui/1700 "Daniel Tsui")

Here’s what we’ve covered so far:

_**Week 1: Intro to Programming**_

* Command line (UNIX)
* Git basics
* Ruby

_**Week 2: Intro to the Web**_

* How the web works (HTTP request/response, TCP)
* Sinatra
* HTML/CSS
* Forms and POST
* File I/O

_**Week 3: Sinatra MVC**_

* SQL
* Sinatra & SQL
* Sinatra & ActiveRecord
* ActiveRecord Associations
* Intro to MVC
* Bundler/gemfile
* Deployment (Heroku)

Covering deployment at the end of this week was probably the most rewarding experience. Everything we have learned has started to come together. Here’s what I got deployed:

* [OMDB Lookup](https://omdb-lookup.herokuapp.com/ "OMDB Lookup")
* [MTA Navigator](https://mta-navigator.herokuapp.com/ "MTA Navigator")

The above two applications have been built with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ "Ruby"), [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/ "Sinatra") and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap").

[Next week](/blog/wdi-the-halfway-mark/ "WDI: The Halfway Mark"), we’ll be moving onto [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/ "Ruby on Rails").
