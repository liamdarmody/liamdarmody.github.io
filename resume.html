    <p>
      I use my 10+ years of experience building startups and enterprise products to help mission-driven product builders achieve impactful results. Alongside my current role where I lead a cross-functional team of product consultants at VMware Tanzu Labs, I am a Co-Active Coach in training and a Board Member of Product Management Festival. Drawing on my experience as the founding licensee of a TEDx event, co-founder of FitUsIn and the first product hire at Pivotal Labs Sydney, I infuse an entrepreneurial flair into my work as a coach, consultant and leader.
